Description:

The bean 'job', defined in class path resource [com/project/springbatch/step9/CompositeItemProcessor/CompositeItemProcessor.class], could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in class path resource [com/project/springbatch/step9/ClassifierCompositeItemProcessor/ClassifierConfiguration.class] and overriding is disabled.

Action:

Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
